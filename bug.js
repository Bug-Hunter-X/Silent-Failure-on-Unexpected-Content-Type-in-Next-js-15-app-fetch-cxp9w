In Next.js 15, an uncommon error can occur when using the `app` directory's `fetch` within a component.  If the API route being fetched returns a response with an unexpected content type (e.g., a non-JSON type like plain text when the component expects JSON), Next.js might not handle the error gracefully, leading to silent failures or unexpected behavior.  The error might not be immediately apparent in the browser's console, making debugging challenging.  The component might render with null or undefined data, or throw a runtime error further down the line.
